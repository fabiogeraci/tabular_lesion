# Tabular Lesion Prediction

The data folder contains six datasets I will be working on.

I will provide information on how the datasets are created, since I am under a disclosure agreement,
but the values are extrapolated from the ProstateX dataset that is available online.

This is very much working in progress, mostly to exhibit some coding style and some ideas.

All constructive comments are appreciated and valued.
